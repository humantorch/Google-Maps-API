Google-Maps-API
===============

Proof of concept using the Google Maps API v2

This was built back in 2009 as an interview homework assignment when I interviewed at TomTom in Amsterdam. Basically, they wanted to see how I wrapped my head around some different mapping functions.

Pretty outdated now, the Google Maps API has changed significantly since that time, but what the hoo-hah.
